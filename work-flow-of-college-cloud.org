#+Title: Work flow of the College-cloud
#+Author: VLEAD

* College Cloud ( CC )
  Use the college cloud to conduct the offline workshop. That means no
  Internet is needed to access the labs.
** User manual for setting up CC and steps for conducting workshop
   [[./user-manual-for-college-cloud.org][User Manual]]
* Instructions to the  workshop coordinator or sysadmin for Collecting the Logs
  1. Use any machine which is connected to College Cloud. Preferably Laptop.
  2. Use the URL -
     =http://<your-college-cloud-ip>/college-cloud-data/=
     - NOTE :: By default =http://10.2.57.61/college-cloud-data/= if
               not modified IPs or anything else in college cloud.
  3. Download the tar.gz file in the format
     <College-name-Date>.tar.gz
* Sending collected logs to VLEAD team
  - *Present solution*

    1. Take downloaded file in pendrive and take a machine with
       internet connection.
    2. Upload the file in google drive and share the google drive link
       with engg@vlabs.ac.in.

  - *Proposed Solution*

    Workshop coordinator/sysadmin has to do the following steps
    1. Take the same machine/Laptop that was connected the college
       cloud.
    2. Take the downloaded file and save this file on your
       machine/Laptop.
    2. Disconnect from College cloud.
    3. Connect the laptop/Machine to the Internet.
    4. Install SyncThing on your machine.
    5. Once SyncThing is installed, Copy the Downloaded file into
       SyncThing directory with the =<Key-College_Name-Date>.tar.gz=
    6. SyncThing will automatically sends incremental files to VLEAD
       team. 
** Reference
   [[./post-processing/index.org][Log collection process]]
* Post Processing
  - Once we have the logs from various Colleges/Institutes, How to
    push analytics, Feedbacks and User Data into respective production
    server - In Progress
  
* College Cloud Contract
  At present,
  1. The College cloud runs without Internet connection.
  2. No videos for the course. It is future implementation.
  3. If Internet connection is needed to the college cloud,Sysadmin has
     to modify the files in various places. It is difficult. *Please
     do not think about giving internet connection to the college
     cloud machine. It will have many consequences.
