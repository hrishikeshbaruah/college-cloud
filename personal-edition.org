#+TITLE: Portable Media - Personal Edition
#+DATE: <2016-09-14 Wed>

* Introduction
  This document describes building a *Personal Edition* for
  virtual-labs.

  Personal-Edition is a portable-media( Hard Disk Drive (HDD)) which
  will have open edx platform installed and labs ported onto it. So
  that we can use this media as portable. 

  Using this portable media, labs can be accessed directly from the
  local machine itself ( no need of internet connection).

** Objective 
   Build the Personal-Edition using two vagrant boxes (virtual
   machines) on a physical machine. 
 
   - First Vagrant Box :: Open edX platform installed and ported labs(
   Labs that are hosted on AWS VMs).
 
   - Second Vagrant Box :: Setup Cluster and host the labs  

   For cluster setup, please follow the documentation of [[https://bitbucket.org/vlead/systems-model/src/97cc25543f8032cb84c1372c4c9ca170945f79a6/src/bootstrapping.org?at%3Ddevelop&fileviewer%3Dfile-view-default][bootstrapping]]
   process.

* Requirements 
** Functional  Requirement
   - Labs that are ported to personal edition should be available in
     one box/machine and all the ported labs should be accessible by
     lab users without the internet connection.
** System Requirements
   The basic requirements are 
   - Operating System : Ubutnu 14.04 LTS
     As we are using it for the open edx platform on production (AWS)
   - RAM : 16 GB
   - Hard Drive : 250 GB for SSD or 400-500 for Magnetic.
** Network bandwidth requirements
   - At least 1 MBPS download speed. 
   - Need stable internet and network proxies if there are any.
* Design
  Diagram :  [[./images/Portable-media-Design.jpg][Design diagram]]
   
  - Router :: Wi-Fi router is responsible for name resolution within
              the LAN network.

  - Physical Machine :: 
       A machine with Ubuntu-14.04 LTS operating systems installed.

  - Vagrant Box (Open edX platform) :: 
       Created on top of Physical machine,this box provides us Open
       edX platform with the labs ported onto it. For the experiment's
       simulations and for the images, this box talks to respective
       labs over the LAN.

       Porting labs :: Get the lab/course sources from [[https://github.com/openedx-vlead][GitHub]] and
       create tar ball and import into Vagrant Box (Open edX platform) 

  - Vagrant Box (Cluster) :: 
       The box with cluster setup.  In this box, labs are
       hosted/deployed locally on OpenVZ containers. Each lab will
       have a separate container so that we can avoid memory leakage
       issues of the labs.

 
* TODO Implementation 
** Setup physical machine
   - Install Ubuntu-14.04 LTS server
   - Install [[http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html][Vagrant]] 1.6.5 or later 
   - Install [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox]] 4.3.12 (i386) or later
   - install other requirements 
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     apt-get install virtualbox-dkms virtualbox-guest-dkms
     #+END_EXAMPLE

** Open edX platform in a Vagrant Box 
   Steps:
   - Create a Vagrant box with the Ubutnu-14.04 LTS
   - Install Open edX platform
   - Import/Port labs to Open edX platform
   - Host/deploy the labs on vagrant box and make these labs available
     to edx platform.

* COMMENT Memory Leakage labs
  - What could be the solution for hosting memory leakage labs on
    personal edition? 
    
    Solution could be:
    for Vagrant box *Vagrant box down* and *vagrant box up* and 
    for Personal edition, *shutdown and restart the machine*

  - How to find out the labs that are causing the memory leakage? 
  - Can we create OpenVZ/Docker containers for the memory leakage
    labs? is it a good idea?
