** PTEST-FULLCC-001 : TEST01 - No load
*** Objective(s)
    To identify the following stats - 
    + CPU run queues
    + Swap in/out
    + Wait time for IO 
    + Memory (RAM) utilization

    when no load on College Cloud and running cluster components.

    + NOTE :: *no load* means, no user requests on college cloud

*** Description
    [[http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vmstat8.html][vmstat]] - Virtual memory stats is a command to get summary
    information on Memory, Processess, CPU, Paging etc.
    
    + Boot CC normally
    + Use the command given below to get statistics -
      #+BEGIN_SRC command
      vmstat 1 1200 -n -w -S M 
      #+END_SRC
    + This command runs for 1200 times and returns output on screen
      every one second.
    + *-S M* is to get output in MB

*** Performance measurements
    + CPU utilization / unit
    + Memory utilization / unit
   
*** Experiment and result
    + [[./raw-data/no-load-run-1-vagrant-up.txt][Raw-Data]]
    + Graph-01 Free RAM / IDLE RAM graph
      The graph given below infers the following -
      + Free RAM / Idle RAM captured at an instance of test. (There
        were 1200 test instances since we ran =vmstat 1 1200 -n -w -S
        M= command for 1200 seconds).
      + Value for FREE RAM is graphed below -
         |------+-------------|
         | Stat | RAM (in MB) |
         |------+-------------|
         | Max  |        6904 |
         |------+-------------|
         | Min  |        6821 |
         |------+-------------|

    + Graph-02 Number of processes waiting for runtime 
      The graph given below infers the following -
      + Number of processes waiting for runtime at an instance of test.
     
      [[./graphs/no-of-process-waiting-for-runtime-no-load.png]]

    + Graph-03 IDLE CPU at an instance of test 
      The graph given below inferes the following -
      + IDLE CPU percentage at an instance of test.

** PTEST-FULLCC-001 : TEST02 - Simple load( 20 concurrent user requests on one lab for 20 minutes)
*** Objective(s)
    To identify the following stats - 
    + CPU run queues
    + Swap in/out
    + Wait time for IO 
    + Memory (RAM) utilization

    when one lab is up and load 20 concurrent user requests for 20 minutes.

    + Now, put load on the lab using *siege* command. Run the below
      command from different machine which is connected to CC through
      LAN
      #+BEGIN_SRC 
      siege -c 20 -r 1 -t 20M http://cse01-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/
