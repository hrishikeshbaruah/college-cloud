     + Any Linux based Operating system running on it
     + Good RAM ( At least 8GB RAM)
     + Good Processor ( At least i5 )

  3. A new Hard Disk Drive (HDD At least 500 GB).
* Steps
  [[../requirements/index.org::#req7][Requirement satisfied]]

  1. Note down the *Serial numbers* of both the HDDs( master and New).
  2. Attach the master copy and new HDD to the machine using SATA and
     Power cables.
  3. Boot the machine from the HDD which has linux based Operating
     Systems( Not from Master copy).

** Steps for CentOS Operating System 
   1. Login to the machine 
   2. Go to *Applications*
   3. Select *System tools*
   4. Select *Disk utility*
   5. Disk utility window will open
   6. On Disk utility window, see the available disk on the left
      side.
   7. Navigate and understand the HDD details on the right side.
   8. Based on serial numbers,care fully note down device names
      (such as =/dev/sdb=, =/dev/sdd=,etc of the master copy and new
      HDD.
   9. Open a terminal
   10. Login as root account
   11. Run the following command.
       Let say, master HDD device name is =/dev/sdc/= and new HDD
       device name is =/dev/sdd/=
	 
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdd
       #+END_EXAMPLE
   12. This copying may take several hours ( may be 4-9 hours depends
       on System Configuration). So, run the above command while
