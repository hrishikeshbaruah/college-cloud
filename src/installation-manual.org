* Introduction
  This manual details the configuration/workflow process to be
  followed for Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition. The College Cloud
  machine/server  will be running without GUI. GUI has been disabled for
  better performance results.
  + College Cloud Edition :: Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition is the
       Portable-Edition for Virtual Labs. It offers the offline
       version of Virtual labs, experiments and theoretical
       content. This edition addresses the lack of internet access or
       poor internet connectivity across different
       institutes/colleges. It results in a very cost-effective
       Learning Management System.
* Requirements
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: requirements
  :END:    

  + College Cloud System Configuration (recommended) 
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 , CPU with 3.40GHz (Model : intel-db75en) 
     RAM : 16 GB 
     SMPS : 600 W 
     CPUs: 8
     MotherBoard wattage: 77 W 
     500 GB SATA   ( Hard Disk Drive - HDD)
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  + WiFi Router : WiFi router which could serve 30-80 users.
  + Computer Lab with at least 30-80 Systems/Desktops.
  + Network Switch Input, from where all the labs would obtain DHCP
    IP) to Computer Lab machines/Desktops. This would make College
    Cloud accessible over the LAN network providing better results.
  + System Administrator with basic knowledge of CentOS operating systems and
    networking.
    
* Configuring College Cloud Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: cc-server
  :END:    

  1. Configure WiFi-Router ::  Router would need to serve 10.2.57.0/24
       to its clients. This would need configuration of LAN settings
       in the router such that router's dhcp server would serve IPs
       from the above IP range to its clients.
  2. Connect the identified College Cloud machine to the configured
     Wi-Fi router through a LAN cable. *Please do not touch the WAN
     port*.
  3. Connect the College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive to the
     identified College Cloud machine.
  4. Boot the machine from College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive.
  5. Please use [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][default linux user credentials]] to login.
     + NOTE :: It is advised that the password is changed after the
               first login . To change the password, follow the [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][link]]
** Launch Virtual Labs (Open edX) platform
 - Run the following command on terminal to run Virtual Labs on
    Open edX platform. This may take a few minutes to launch the
    platform.
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cd vagrant-boxes
    vagrant-boxes$vagrant up     #Look for Vagrant file in "vlabs" account and run this command
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  - College Cloud edition of Virtual Labs is now ready for use.
* Passwords
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: passwords
  :END:    
   The first login password for =vlabs= user account would be

   Drive. 

   Other default user credentials could be accessed at =passwords.txt=
   in College Cloud server at =~/passwords.txt= when logged in as
   =vlabs= user.

** Changing Passwords
  Please note that change of passwords will not be reflected in the
  default password file located at =~/passwords.txt= on College Cloud
  server and it would be the responsibility of the System
  Administrator to manage these passwords.

** List of labs hosted on College Cloud Edition
   - [[./labs-on-college-cloud/list-of-labs-in-college-cloud.org::#list-of-labs][Labs on College Cloud]]
** Selecting labs
   - Use the link =http://<College-Cloud-Machine-IP>:3000=
   - This would prompt for the user name and password. Please provide
     [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][default user credentials]].

   [[https://openvz.org/Control_panels#OVZ_Web_Panel][OpenVZ web panel]] is for managing Virtual Labs running on localhost
   (College Cloud). Each lab has one OpenVZ container. *By default,
   all lab containers would be in stopped state*. However, the server
   nodes would be in running state( This needs to be kept in the
   running state).

   - Server nodes are

   - Once logged into the web panel: 

     + Look for =localhost= on left side of the panel.
     +  Click on =localhost=.
     + A list all labs with their respective OpenVZ container
       status(stopped/running) would be visible.

   - WARNING :: *Please do not tampered with with the college cloud
                setup settings.*

** Starting Lab containers
    1. Go to the platform http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in
    2. Select the course/lab to be included in the workshop. Please
       make a note of the course/lab name.
    3. Go to =http://<College-Cloud-Machine-IP>:3000= 
    4. Sign into =OpenVZ web panel=. For credentials, please follow
       the [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][passwords]]
    5. Click on =localhost= located at left side of the panel.
    6. Search for the lab name that has been selected in step 2.
    7. Choose the selected lab by clicking on CTID (example.213) and
       look for =change state= button on the panel.
    8. Select =start= and wait for about 1-2 minutes. 
    9. Observe the change of color of the selected course/lab in green
       color and running state.

** Enhancing Performance
    + If a server grade machine/system *(>=32 GB RAM,
      Intel Xenon processor)* is being used all lab containers that
      are stopped cane be started.

    + If an *Intel i7 processor and 16GB RAM machine/system* is being
      used a maximum of 50-100 simultaneous users can access one lab at a time.

      - It is advised to only start labs that are needed for the
        workshop.
      - The best choice would be start one lab at a time and have a
        maximum of 10 labs running at any given instance.
       
** Monitoring system resources
   [[https://www.nagios.org/][Nagios]] is used for monitoring systems resources such as load on the
   machine, RAM usage, Processes, etc.
   - Use the link =http://<College-Cloud-Machine-IP>/nagios=
   - Use the Nagios [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][default user credentials]]

    + NOTE :: It is advised that the password is changed after the
              first login . For the steps for changing the password,
