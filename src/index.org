#+TITLE: College Cloud Edition
#+DATE: <2016-09-14 Wed>

* Introduction
  The document describes building a *College Cloud Edition* for
  virtual-labs.

  *College Cloud Edition* is a portable-media( Hard Disk Drive (HDD))
  which will have Open edX platform installed and labs ported onto it.

  Using the portable media, labs can be accessed directly from the
  local machine itself (no need of internet connection).

** Objective 
   Build the Portable-Edition on HDD and make it portable. The
   portable media can be used for accessing the labs from local
   machine (no need of internet connection).

* COMMENT Memory Leakage labs
  - What could be the solution for hosting memory leakage labs on
    personal edition? 
    
    Solution could be:
    for Vagrant box *Vagrant box down* and *vagrant box up* and 
    for Personal edition, *shutdown and restart the machine*

  - How to find out the labs that are causing the memory leakage? 
  - Can we create OpenVZ/Docker containers for the memory leakage
    labs? is it a good idea?
