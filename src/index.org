#+TITLE: Portable Edition
#+DATE: <2016-09-14 Wed>

* Introduction
  The document describes building a *Portable Edition* for
  virtual-labs.

  Portable-Edition is a portable-media( Hard Disk Drive (HDD)) which
  will have Open edX platform installed and labs ported onto it.

  Using the portable media, labs can be accessed directly from the
  local machine itself (no need of internet connection).

** Objective 
   Build the Portable-Edition on HDD and make it portable. The
   portable media can be used for accessing the labs from local
   machine (no need of internet connection).
 
* Requirements
** Portable Edition Requirements
   - Build a portable hard drive with X labs on it.
   - Create a facility for collecting logs and Collecting analytics.

  - Wi-Fi Router :: Wi-Fi router resolves the domain name(FQDN) of the
              labs within the LAN network. And it allocates dhcp ips
              to the Vagrant boxes and to the users who wants to acces
              the labs. Configure the wi-fi router such that it has to
              provide 10.2.57.0/24 subnet ip range to its clients.

  - Portable edition of Virtual Labs :: 
       A portable edition, which contains Open edX platform and ported
       labs onto it. One vagrant box will be used for Open edX
       platform.

       
       Static IP (10.2.57.61) will be assigned to this machine.

    + Vagrant Box (Open edX platform) ::
	 Virtual-Labs portable edition ,this box provides us Open edX
         platform with the labs ported onto it. For the simulations of
         experiments and for the images, this box contacts to
         *Cluster* for the labs over the LAN.

	 Static IP(10.2.57.65) is to be assigned to this box.
  
    + Cluster :: 
		 It runs on localhost (Host machine) and serves labs
                 to the Open edX platform. In this cluster, labs are
                 hosted/deployed locally on OpenVZ containers and also
                 runs server nodes. Each lab will have a separate
                 container so that we can avoid memory leakage issues
                 of the labs.
		 - Cluster server nodes are 
		   + Router :: is for forwarding incoming packets to
                               respective server nodes
		   + Reverse proxy :: Accepts http and https packets
                                      from router and forwards these
                                      packets to respective labs.
		   + Public DNS :: For external name resolution 
		   + Private DNS :: For internal name resolution

		   + ADS :: A service for hosting new labs inside the
                            cluster
	          
                   + Config-Server :: To configure cluster with
                                      automated scripts using ansible
                                      playbooks

		 Static IP(10.2.57.62) is to be assigned to Router
                 container.

		 Static IP(10.2.57.63) is to be assigned to
                 Config-server container.

  - ELK stack :: ELK(Elasticsearch,Logstash and Kibana) stack runs on
                 localhost. ELK is responsible for collecting the logs
                 and showing the analytics of the labs. 
		 
		 ELK will be used by analytics-api service

    + Elasticsearch - A storage, No Sql database. It acts as backend
      data store for logstash.
    + Logstash - A log processor, can process any data - from any source
    + Kibana - Analytics visualization tool. Acts as a frontend tool
      to logstash
  - DNS service :: Runs in separate container on localhost. This
                   service will be used by Wi-Fi router for name
                   resolution( To map IP with FQDN).
		   
		   DNS service will be configured using ansible
                   playbooks from config-server. Use =public_dns.yml=
                   playbook to configure DNS service
		   
		   Static IP :: 10.2.57.64
  
   - Analytics to be captured from portable hardrive version. [[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/portable-media/issues/2][Read link]]
   - Analytics to be fetched from portble hardrive version.  [[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/portable-media/issues/2][Read link]]
  - Nagios :: Nagios is a monitoring tool. Job of the nagios in this
              setup is to monitor system resources such as RAM,
              Processes,etc.
  
* Implementation 
  Implementation is done based on the above design diagram.
  We need internet connection for
  - Setting up cluster
  - Hosting the labs in the cluster using ADS service
** Machine setup
   - Install CentOS-6.x Desktop
   - Update OS
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     yum update -y
     #+END_EXAMPLE

** Cluster setup
   - All server nodes are not needed for portable-media cluster setup
     . So comment =nagios_server=, =nagios_client=,
     =rsnapshot_server=, =rsnapshot_client=, =ossec_server= and
     =ossec_client= roles in following playbooks before running them.
   
   - In this cluster setup, we need only following server nodes.
     + Config-Server
     + Router
     + Public DNS
     + Private DNS 
     + Reverse proxy
     + ADS service

   - Use [[https://bitbucket.org/vlead/systems-model/src/97cc25543f8032cb84c1372c4c9ca170945f79a6/src/bootstrapping.org?at%3Ddevelop&fileviewer%3Dfile-view-default][bootstrapping steps]] till ADS server configuration for setting
     up cluster.  Cluster will have OpenVZ containers. Each server
     node will have a separate container and also for each lab.

   - Once you reach running =site.yaml= in bootstrapping steps, perform
     the following steps.     
     + Comment following servers in =site.yaml= file.
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       rsnapshot_server.yaml
       ossec_server.yaml
       nagios_server.yaml
       rsyslog_server.yaml
       lab_rsnapshot_server.yaml
       #- include: ads_server.yaml
       #+END_EXAMPLE
     + Comment all other nodes if there are any which are not needed
       for the portable media.
     + Set private dns ips and private-dns-zone as follows, and
       comment =private-dns-ips: none=, =private-dns-zone: none= in
       common_vars role.
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       private_dns_ips: 
          - 10.100.1.5
       private_dns_zone: "{{prefix}}virtual-labs.ac.in {{prefix}}vlabs.ac.in"
       #+END_EXAMPLE
     + Run site.yaml
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       ansible-playbook -i hosts --list-tasks --syntax-check site.yaml
       ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yaml
       #+END_EXAMPLE

** DNS service configuration
   - Create a separate OpenVZ container for dns service 
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     vzctl create 1010 --ostemplate centos-6-x86_64  --hostname dns.vlabs.ac.in
     vzctl set 1010 --netif_add eth0,,,,br0  --save 
     vzctl set 1010 --onboot yes --save
     vzctl start 1010
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Configure network in dns container
     + Enter into the container
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       vzctl enter 1010
       #+END_EXAMPLE
     + Open/create the file 
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
       #+END_EXAMPLE
     + Update above file with 
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       DEVICE=eth0
       TYPE=Ethernet
       HWADDR=<MAC address of the eth0 interface>
       BOOTPROTO=static
       ONBOOT=yes
       NM_CONTROLLED=no
       IPADDR=<ip-address>
       NETMASK=<netmask>
       GATEWAY=<gateway>
       DNS1=<external-dns1>
       DNS2=<external-dns2>
       #+END_EXAMPLE

    + Enable SSH access to root account from config-server 
      - Set root password for DNS server node and remember or note it
        down somewhere
      - From config-server, perform the following steps
	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	ssh-copy-id root@10.2.57.65 
	#+END_EXAMPLE
      - Provide the password when prompted for root password.

    + Since we are setting up a separate DNS server which is not a
      part of the cluster, but we are using =public_dns.yaml= playbook
      for running the ansible playbook for this server as well. It
      will try to set up the gateway as 10.100.1.1 which would throw
      error as our DNS is not a part of the cluster. To solve this
      problem, we need to comment the default gateway lines in
      =roles/common/tasks/main.yml= file in the ansible sever. Below
      lines should be commented
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #- name: setting the default gw, skips if router or ansible server
      #  shell: route del default; route add default gw {{router_internal_ip}}
      #  when: not ( i_ans is defined or i_router is defined )
      #  ignore_errors: yes
      #
      #- name: make this route persistent after reboot
      #  lineinfile: line="route del default; route add default gw {{router_internal_ip}}" destfile=/etc/rc.local state=present regexp="route *"
      #  when: not ( i_ans is defined or i_router is defined )
      #+END_EXAMPLE
    + Run =public_dns.yml= playbook from config-server to configure
      dns service which is outside the cluster.
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      vlead$cd systems-model/build/edx/
      vlead$vim dns.txt     # inventory file for DNS service node
      #+END_EXAMPLE
      - Add the following lines to the file =dns.txt=
	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	[public_dns]
	10.2.57.65        # DNS service node ip address
	#+END_EXAMPLE
      - Run =public_dns.yml=
	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	vlead$ansible-playbook -i dns.txt public_dns.yml
	#+END_EXAMPLE
    + Change =/etc/resolv.conf= file 
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      vim /etc/resolv.conf
      and add
      nameserver 127.0.0.1    # as localhost has become name server 
      #+END_EXAMPLE
    + Add these entries in =/var/named/{cluster}.virtual-labs.ac.in.forward= and
      =/var/named/{cluster}.vlabs.ac.in.forward=
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      open-edx         IN    A     10.2.57.65
      #+END_EXAMPLE
    + Restart DNS service =named=
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      service named restart
      #+END_EXAMPLE
    + You are done configuring DNS service

* COMMENT Memory Leakage labs
  - What could be the solution for hosting memory leakage labs on
    personal edition? 
    
    Solution could be:
    for Vagrant box *Vagrant box down* and *vagrant box up* and 
    for Personal edition, *shutdown and restart the machine*

  - How to find out the labs that are causing the memory leakage? 
  - Can we create OpenVZ/Docker containers for the memory leakage
    labs? is it a good idea?
