#+Title: Inference from the Apache benchmark test 
#+Date: January 18, 2017
#+Author: VLEAD Systems 

* Introduction 
  This document refers the raw data fetched from the Apache benchmark test.

* Test Procedure and details 
  + Tool used :: Apache benchmark 
  + Test Subject :: Open edX on portable media and Host Server
  + No of labs running :: 5 Labs are running and rest of them were turned off.
  + Apache benchmark simulates requests to a particular URL or web page. 
  + Sample command 
    #+BEGIN_SRC 
    ab -c 10 -n 500 http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in/
    #+END_SRC
  + The above command throws 500 total requests to the URL http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in
  + Here, -c is the number of concurrent requests at an instance of time 
  + Here, -n is the number of total requests made to the server.

* Understanding the sample results -
  + Command used 
    #+BEGIN_SRC 
    ab -c 10 -n 1000 http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in
    #+END_SRC
  + Sample output snippet obtained . 
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    Concurrency Level:      10
    Time taken for tests:   9.256 seconds
    Complete requests:      1000
    Failed requests:        0
    Requests per second:    108.04 [#/sec] (mean)
    Time per request:       92.559 [ms] (mean)
    Time per request:       9.256 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
    #+END_SRC
  + Explaination for the above terms ::
    + Concurrency level ::
         Number of requests at an instance of time. This can be
         considered as number of users making a request at an instance
         of time, where each user make a single request.
    + Time taken for tests ::
         This is the time taken to complete the test. 
         = Time at which last request was made - Time at which first request was made.
    + Complete Requests ::
      Number of requests which resulted into 200,201,404 error code. 
    + Failed Requests ::
      Number of requests which resulted into 503 - Service not available.
    + Time per request (1) ::
      Mean time taken to serve one set of concurrent request.
      For example if c = 10 and n = 100, we have 10 concurrent sets.
    + Time per request (2) ::
      Mean time taken to server one request out of concurrency set.
      For example, if c = 10, then it is one concurrency set.

* Inference
  + Each row in the above obeservation table display the result of test with various concurrencly level. 
  + Each row can be read as given below - 
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  When 10 requests are sent to http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in/ at a time instance t1, it took 92.656 ms to complete 10 requests.
  Total 1500 rquests were sent in burst of 10. On an average each request takes 92.656 ms.
  #+END_SRC
** Assumtions 
  + Its quite likely that web caching at reverse proxy might have
    resulted into faster response.
  
  + Based on the above output, it can be assured that 50/60 people can
    use College cloud with enough performance.
  + Using Sar command on host machine hosting labs and open edx, Memory
    (RAM) was observed to be used only upto 79.85 %
