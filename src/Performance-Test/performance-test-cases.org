#+Title: Portable Media performance Test cases
#+Author: VLEAD



* Introduction
  The documnent describes the performance of the portable media.

* Performance Testing 
  + Performance testing is the testing, which is performed, to
    ascertain how the components of a system are performing, given a
    particular situation.
  + Components of our interest are CPU usage, Memory (RAM) utlization
    of machine under test.
  
* Load Testing of System 
  + Load testing is meant to test the system by constantly and
    steadily increasing the load on the system till the time it
    reaches the threshold limit.
  + Purpose of load testing is to assign the system the largest job it
    could possible handle to test the endurance and monitoring the
    results.


* Test System 
  Machine with the below given configuration (used for portable media
  college cloud) is subjected to tests.
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
       Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz   (Mother Board Model : intel-db75en)
       RAM : 16 GB
       SMPS : 600 W
       CPUs: 8
       MotherBoard wattage: 77 W
  #+END_SRC

* Test parameters or components to be observed
  + Number of users accessing the system in unit time. 
  + Number of requests in unit time
  + Average number of requests per unit time.
  + CPU usage and Memory utilization in various scenarios.
  + Load and Performance with variable number of containers running at
    an instance of test.
 

* Test Cases 
  Higly probable cases are listed as below -

** Test P-TEST-SCENARIO-1 : Run 1 lab container 
*** Evaluate the values for the test parameters with variable test arguments 
    + Vary the number of users hitting the system for particular time period
       = vary(no_of_users/requests) and vary(time interval for which machine was subjected to test)
** Test P-TEST-SCENARIO-2 : Increment the lab containers runnning at an instance of time 
    + Vary the number of users hitting the system for particular time period
        = vary(no_of_users/requests) and vary(time interval for which machine was subjected to test)
    + Vary the number of labs running in portable media at an instance of time 
        = vary(the number of labs running at instant of time) and vary(number of users/requests) and vary(time interval for which machine was sujected to test)
