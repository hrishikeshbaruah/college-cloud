#+Title: Inference from the Apache benchmark test 
#+Date: January 18, 2017
#+Author: VLEAD Systems 

* Introduction 
  This document refers the raw data fetched from the Apache benchmark test.

* Test Procedure and details 
  + Tool used :: Apache benchmark 
  + Test Subject :: localhost lab on portable media and Host Server
  + Apache benchmark simulates requests to a particular URL or web page. 
  + Sample command 
    #+BEGIN_SRC 
    ab -c 10 -n 500 http://ccnsb06-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/
    #+END_SRC
  + The above command throws 500 total requests to the URL http://ccnsb06-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/
  + Here, -c is the number of concurrent requests at an instance of time 
  + Here, -n is the number of total requests made to the server.

* Understanding the sample results -
  + Command used 
    #+BEGIN_SRC 
    ab -c 10 -n 1000 http://cse19-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/
    #+END_SRC
  + Sample output snippet obtained . 
    #+BEGIN_SRC
Concurrency Level:      10
Time taken for tests:   3.861 seconds
Complete requests:      1000
Failed requests:        0
Requests per second:    258.98 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       38.612 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       3.861 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
    #+END_SRC
  + Explaination for the above terms ::
    + Concurrency level ::
         Number of requests at an instance of time. This can be
         considered as number of users making a request at an instance
         of time, where each user make a single request.
    + Time taken for tests ::
         This is the time taken to complete the test. 
         = Time at which last request was made - Time at which first request was made.
    + Complete Requests ::
      Number of requests which resulted into 200,201,404 error code. 
    + Failed Requests ::
      Number of requests which resulted into 503 - Service not available.
    + Time per request (1) ::
      Mean time taken to serve one set of concurrent request.
      For example if c = 10 and n = 100, we have 10 concurrent sets.
    + Time per request (2) ::
      Mean time taken to server one request out of concurrency set.
      For example, if c = 10, then it is one concurrency set.

* Inference
** Assumtions 
  + Its quite likely that web caching at reverse proxy might have
    resulted into faster response.
  
  + Based on the above output, it can be assured that 50/60 people can
    use College cloud with enough performance.
  + Using Sar command on host machine hosting lab, Memory (RAM) was
    observed to be used only upto 63.93 %
