#+Title: Inference from the Apache benchmark test 
#+Date: JAnuary 5, 2016
#+Author: VLEAD Systems 


* Introduction 
  This document refers the raw data fetched from the Apache benchmark test.
  
* Test Procedure and details 
  + Tool used :: Apache benchmark 
  + Subject :: Open edX on portable media and Host Server
  + Apache benchmark simulates requests to a particular URL or web page. 
  + Sample command 
    #+BEGIN_SRC 
    ab -c 10 -n 500 http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in/
    #+END_SRC
  + The above command throws 500 total requests to the URL http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in
  + Here, -c is the number of concurrent requests at an instance of time 
  + Here, -n is the number of total requests made to the server.

* Understanding the sample results -
  + Command used 
    #+BEGIN_SRC 
    ab -c 10 -n 1000 http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in
    #+END_SRC
  + Sample output snippet obtained . 
    #+BEGIN_SRC
     Concurrency Level:      10  
     Time taken for tests:   35.868 seconds
     Complete requests:      1000
     Failed requests:        0
     Time per request:       358.676 [ms] (mean)
     Time per request:       35.868 [ms]
    #+END_SRC
  + Explaination for the above terms ::
    + Concurrency level ::
         Number of requests at an instance of time. This can be
         considered as number of users making a request at an instance
         of time, where each user make a single request.
    + Time taken for tests ::
         This is the time taken to complete the test. 
         = Time at which last request was made - Time at which first request was made.
    + Complete Requests ::
      Number of requests which resulted into 200,201,404 error code. 
    + Failed Requests ::
      Number of requests which resulted into 503 - Service not available.
    + Time per request (1) ::
      Mean time taken to serve one set of concurrent request.
      For example if c = 10 and n = 100, we have 10 concurrent sets.
    + Time per request (2) ::
      Mean time taken to server one request out of concurrency set.
      For example, if c = 10, then it is one concurrency set.
