* Introduction
  This manual details the configuration/workflow process to be
  followed for Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition. The College Cloud
  machine/server  will be running without GUI. GUI has been disabled for
  better performance results.

* Requirements
  + College Cloud System Configuration (recommended) 
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 , CPU with 3.40GHz (Model : intel-db75en) 
     RAM : 16 GB 
     SMPS : 600 W 
     CPUs: 8
     MotherBoard wattage: 77 W 
     500 GB SATA   ( Hard Disk Drive - HDD)
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  + WiFi Router : WiFi router which could serve 30-80 users.
  + Computer Lab with at least 30-80 Systems/Desktops.
  + Network Switch Input, from where all the labs would obtain DHCP
    IP) to Computer Lab machines/Desktops. This would make College
    Cloud accessible over the LAN network providing better results.
  + System Administrator with basic knowledge of CentOS operating systems and
    networking.
    
* Configuration for making a machine as College Cloud Server
  - Configure WiFi-Router :: Router would need to serve 10.2.57.0/24
       to its clients. This would need configuration of LAN settings
       in the router such that router's dhcp server would serve IPs
       from the above IP range to its clients.
  - Take a LAN cable and connect it to college cloud machine. This
    connection has to come from router only. *Please do not touch WAN
    port*.
  - Take the Hard Disk Drive ( HDD ) 
  - Boot the machine from College Cloud edition ( HDD ) through USB
  - Please use default linux user credentials to log into the College
    Cloud edition.
    + NOTE :: It is advised that the password is changed after the
              first login . To change the password, follow the [[Linux user Password][Link]]
** Launch Virtual Labs (Open edX) platform
 - Run the following command on terminal to run Virtual Labs on
    Open edX platform. This may take a few minutes to launch the
    platform.
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cd vagrant-boxes
    vagrant-boxes$vagrant up     #Look for Vagrant file in "vlabs" account and run this command
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  - College Cloud edition of Virtual Labs is now ready for use.
** Changing Passwords
   Please note that change of passwords will not be reflected in the
   default password file located at =~/passwords.txt= on College Cloud
   server and it would be the responsibility of the System
   Administrator to manage these passwords.

*** Default user credentials
    Default user credentials are saved in a file called
    =passwords.txt= in College Cloud server at =~/passwords.txt= in
    =vlabs= user account.
    
    Default password for *vlabs* account is *admin123*. 

*** Linux user Password
    - Use =passwd= command to change the passwords of =vlabs= and
      =root=
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      vlabspasswd     # to change vlabs user 

      root#passwd     # for change root user 
      #+END_EXAMPLE
*** OpenVZ web panel user password

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    sudo ruby /opt/ovz-web-panel/script/runner -e production 'user = User.find_by_login("admin"); user.password = "admin"; user.save(false)'
    #+END_EXAMPLE
*** Nagios user password
    Run the below command on terminal. 
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    sudo htpasswd -C /etc/nagios/passwd nagiosadmin
    #+END_EXAMPLE 
*** Open edX platform default user password change
    Change admin( default) user from django-administration
    page. Access this page using =http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in/admin.

* Using College Cloud Edition
  College System Administrator/Workshop coordinator should follow the
  steps for enabling students to use labs from College Cloud.
** Selecting labs
   - Use the link =http://<College-Cloud-Machine-IP>:3000=
   - This would prompt for the user name and password. Please provide
     [[Default user credentials][default user credentials]]. 
    + NOTE :: It is advised that the password is changed after the
              first login . For the steps for changing the password,
              follow the [[OpenVZ web panel user password][link]]


   [[https://openvz.org/Control_panels#OVZ_Web_Panel][OpenVZ web panel]] is for managing Virtual Labs running on localhost
   (College Cloud). Each lab has one OpenVZ container. *By default,
   all lab containers would be in stopped state*. However, the server
   nodes would be in running state( This needs to be kept in the
   running state).

   - Server nodes are

   - Once logged into the web panel: 

     + Look for =localhost= on left side of the panel.
     +  Click on =localhost=.
     + A list all labs with their respective OpenVZ container
       status(stopped/running) would be visible.

   - WARNING :: *Please do not tampered with with the college cloud
                setup settings.*

** Starting Lab containers
    1. Go to the platform http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in
    2. Select the course/lab to be included in the workshop. Please
       make a note of the course/lab name.
    3. Go to =http://<College-Cloud-Machine-IP>:3000= 
    4. Sign into =OpenVZ web panel=. For credentials, please follow the [[OpenVZ web panel user password][Link]]
    5. Click on =localhost= located at left side of the panel.
    6. Search for the lab name that has been selected in step 2.
    7. Cchoose the selected lab by clicking on CTID (ex.213) and look for
       =change state= button on the panel.
    8. Select =start= and wait for about 1-2 minutes. 
    9. TODO : Observe the change of color of the selected course/lab..

** Enhancing Performance
    + If a server grade machine/system *(>=32 GB RAM,
      Intel Xenon processor)* is being used all lab containers that
      are stopped cane be started.

    + If an *Intel i7 processor and 16GB RAM machine/system* is being
      used a maximum of 50-100 simultaneous users can access one lab at a time.

      - It is advised to only start labs that are needed for the
        workshop.
      - The best choice would be start one lab at a time and have a
        maximum of 10 labs running at any given instance.
       
** Monitoring system resources
   [[https://www.nagios.org/][Nagios]] is used for monitoring systems resources such as load on the
   machine, RAM usage, Processes, etc.
   - Use the link =http://<College-Cloud-Machine-IP>/nagios=
   - Use the Nagios [[Default user credentials][default user credentials]]

    + NOTE :: It is advised that the password is changed after the
              first login . For the steps for changing the password,
              follow the [[Nagios user password][link]]
** Instructions for Lab users		   
   College System Administrator/Workshop Coordinator to issue the
   following instructions to all lab users:
*** Changing DNS settings
    - Lab users can access the labs through LAN cable and also over
      wireless. 
    - LAN cable should be connected to the WiFi-router.
    - Once connected to the wireless or LAN, lab user should modify
      the change DNS settings.
