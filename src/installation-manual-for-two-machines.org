* Introduction
  This manual details the configuration to be followed for installation of the Virtual
  Labs College Cloud Edition on two machines.

* Audience
  This doument is meant for System Administrators who want to setup the College
  Cloud in their institute, the two machine style.
  
* Requirements 
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: requirements
  :END:    
  The following are a list of recommended requirements to setup the
  college cloud.
  
  1. Two machines with the following configuration
     + Cluster Machine :: Labs and cluster containers
          would be running on this machine.
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 , CPU with 3.40GHz (Model : intel-db75en) 
     RAM : 32 GB 
     No of Cores: 8
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     + edX Machine :: This machine is dedicated solely for the edX
                      platform to run.
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 , CPU with 3.40GHz (Model : intel-db75en) 
     RAM : 16 GB 
     No of Cores : 8  
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     
  2. *Two* SATA Hard disks (minimum 500GB each) for the transfer of College Cloud Editions.
   
  3. Wifi Router : A basic router which supports DHCP.  
  
  4. Computer Lab with at least 30-50 Desktops.
  
  5. Network Switch Input, from where all the labs would obtain DHCP
     IP) to Computer Lab Desktops. This would make College
     Cloud accessible over the LAN network providing better results.
     
  6. System Administrator with basic knowledge of CentOS operating systems and
     networking.
     

* Steps for configuring the two machines
  The following diagram depicts the setup of the two machines that need to be configured.

** Configure Wifi router
   The sysadmin must configure the router to serve 10.2.57.0/24 IP range
   to its clients. This would require configuring the LAN settings
   in the router such that router's dhcp server serves IPs
   from the above IP range.
       	
       - NOTE :: During Wi-Fi router configuration, DNS server should be set to
       *10.2.57.62.* 
       Adding DNS server IP, varies from router to
       router. For example,
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       primary DNS 10.2.57.62
       or
       DNS1        10.2.57.62
       or 
       nameserver  10.2.57.62
       or
       domain name 10.2.57.62
       #+END_EXAMPLE

** Cluster Machine setup
   In this machine, edX platform should not be running as it is
   running from =System 1= as depicted in the diagram above.

   Steps to configure cluster machine

   1. Identify the cluster machine mentioned above in the requirements section. 
   
   2. Connect the College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive to the
      Cluster machine.
  
   3. Connect the Cluster machine to the configured
      Wi-Fi router through a LAN cable. *Please do not touch the WAN
      port*.
      
   4. Boot the machine from College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive.
   
   5. Please use [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][default linux user credentials]] to login.
      + NOTE :: It is advised that the password is changed after the
               	first login . To change the password, follow the [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][link]]


** edX Machine setup 
*** Configuring edX College Cloud Server
    :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: cluster-cc1
   :END:
   
   1. Identify the edX machine mentioned above in the requirements section. 

   2. Connect the College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive to the
      edX machine.

   3. Connect the identified College Cloud machine to the configured
      Wi-Fi router through a LAN cable. *Please do not touch the WAN
      port*.
      
   4. Boot the machine from College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive.
   
   5. Please use [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][default linux user credentials]] to login.
      + NOTE :: It is advised that the password is changed after the
               	first login . To change the password, follow the [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][link]]


* Start and Stop Labs
  Since this setup cannot support all the virtual labs, please limit to 5
  labs.  This is achieved by starting only those machines running the selected
  labs and stop all other lab machines.

  To stop and start machines, read this [[./installation-manual.org::#start-lab-containers][documentation]].


* Collection of Logs
  Please follow this [[./installation-manual.org::#analytics-feedbacks][documentation]] to collect logs.
