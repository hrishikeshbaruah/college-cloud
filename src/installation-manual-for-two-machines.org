* Introduction
  This manual details the configuration to be followed for Virtual
  Labs College Cloud Edition with two machines
* Requirements 
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: requirements
  :END:    
  1. Two machines with following configuration
     + Machine 1 :: In this machine, Only edx platform would be
                         running.
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 , CPU with 3.40GHz (Model : intel-db75en) 
     RAM : 32 GB 
     No of Cores : 8  
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     + Machine 2 :: In this machine, labs and cluster containers
                        would be running.
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 , CPU with 3.40GHz (Model : intel-db75en) 
     RAM : 16 GB 
     No of Cores: 8
     #+END_EXAMPLE

  2. *Two* College Cloud Editions
  3. Wifi Router
  4. Computer Lab with at least 30-50 Systems/Desktops.
  5. Network Switch Input, from where all the labs would obtain DHCP
     IP) to Computer Lab machines/Desktops. This would make College
     Cloud accessible over the LAN network providing better results.
  6. System Administrator with basic knowledge of CentOS operating systems and
     networking.
* Steps for configuring two machines
** Configure Wifi router
   + Configure WiFi-Router ::  Router would need to serve 10.2.57.0/24
       to its clients. This would need configuration of LAN settings
       in the router such that router's dhcp server would serve IPs
       from the above IP range to its clients.
       	
       *NOTE :: During Wi-Fi router configuration, DNS server should be
       10.2.57.62.* *Adding DNS server ip, varies from router to
       router. For example*,
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       primary DNS 10.2.57.62
       or
       DNS1        10.2.57.62
       or 
       nameserver  10.2.57.62
       or
       domain name 10.2.57.62
       #+END_EXAMPLE
** Machine 1 setup 
*** Configuring College Cloud Server
    :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: cluster-cc1
   :END:    

   1. Connect the identified College Cloud machine to the configured
      Wi-Fi router through a LAN cable. *Please do not touch the WAN
      port*.
   2. Connect the College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive to the
      identified College Cloud machine.
   3. Boot the machine from College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive.
   4. Please use [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][default linux user credentials]] to login.
      + NOTE :: It is advised that the password is changed after the
               	first login . To change the password, follow the [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][link]]
*** More procedures to be done on machine 1
    There are other procedures to be in machine1. They are available
    at the following locations
    
    - [[./installation-manual.org::#using-cc-server][How to use College cloud Edition]]
    - [[./installation-manual.org::#cc-work-flow][Workflow of College Cloud Edition]]

** Machine 2 setup
   *In this machine, edx platform should not be running as it is
   running from machine1*
*** Configuring College Cloud Server
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: cluster-cc2
    :END:      

   1. Connect the identified College Cloud machine to the configured
      Wi-Fi router through a LAN cable. *Please do not touch the WAN
      port*.
   2. Connect the College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive to the
      identified College Cloud machine.
   3. Boot the machine from College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive.
   4. Please use [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][default linux user credentials]] to login.
      + NOTE :: It is advised that the password is changed after the
               	first login . To change the password, follow the [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][link]]

*** Launch Virtual Labs (Open edX) platform
   1. Run the following command on terminal to run Virtual Labs on Open
      edX platform. This may take a few minutes to launch the platform.
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       cd vagrant-boxes
       vagrant-boxes$vagrant up     #Look for Vagrant file in "vlabs" account and run this command
       vagrant-boxes$vagrant up --provision
       #+END_EXAMPLE
   2. College Cloud edition of Virtual Labs is now ready for use.
   3. [[./installation-manual.org::#instructions][Follow the instructions]] to access vlabs.ac.in page
   4. Access the vlabs.ac.in page, at this time no lab simulations
      would be accessible. To access the simulations of the labs,
      first understand [[./installation-manual.org::#using-cc-server][Using College Cloud Edition]]
*** Stop all the containers including cluster containers
     Stop the containers that are running on college cloud including
     cluster server containers.
