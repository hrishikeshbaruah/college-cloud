#+TITLE: Meeting Minutes
* Meeting minutes with Mr. Maruthi Rao Sir
** 2016-09-30 Friday
   Attendees :: Mr.Maruthi Rao, Priya, Sanchita, Siva and Aashay

   Discussed on hardware requirements and other portable media issues

   Issues found in Portable media while adding courses to Open edX
   platform 

   - SSL certificate issues.
   - Videos are not loading in open edx platform, reason is, these
     videos are loading from youtube.com. Videos are actually uploaded
     by lab developers.
*** Action items 
    - Need to discuss with Prof. Venkatesh and with other team members
      in daily meetings.
      + on Hardware requirements
      + SSL certificate issues 
      + Videos in Portable media
    - Queries ::
      + Do we have any available Wi-Fi routers, System requirements (
	base machines) and LAN switches if there are in our Server room?

      + If there is a chance to take out one base machine, what are the
	consequences, if there any how to solve?

	Action for above two queries :: Based on Monday's discussion

    - Work on SSL certificates
      + Self signed certificates 
       
	- Action :: Created Self signed certificates and added them in
		    Reverseproxy to serve HTTPS.
      
	- Result :: Error while taking courses on Open edX platform
		    *Connection is not secure*
       
      + Without ssl certificates       
	- Without SSL, we may experience problems in simulations of
	  experiments of each lab. Because all simulations of
	  experiments of each lab using Iframe in Open edX platform
	  and uses HTTPS.
	 
	  Solution can be grep and replace https with http in all the
	  labs 
** Proposed and changed designed plans

  - Router :: Wi-Fi router is resolves the domain name(FQDN) of the
              labs within the LAN network. And it allocates dhcp ips
              to the Vagrant boxes and to the users who wants to acces
              the labs. Configure the wi-fi router such that it has to
              provide 192.168.1.0/24 subnet ip range to its clients.

  - Portable edition of Virtual Labs :: 
       A portable edition, which contains Open edX platform and ported
       labs onto it. One vagrant box will be used for Open edX
       platform.

       
       Static IP (192.168.1.3) will be assigned to this machine.

    + Vagrant Box (Open edX platform) ::
	 Virtual-Labs portable edition ,this box provides us Open edX
         platform with the labs ported onto it. For the simulations of
         experiments and for the images, this box contacts to *Cluster
         Vagrant box* for the labs over the LAN.

	 Static IP(192.168.1.4) is to be assigned to this box.
  
    + Cluster :: 
		 It runs on localhost (Host machine) and serves labs
                 to the Open edX platform. In this cluster, labs are
                 hosted/deployed locally on OpenVZ containers and also
                 runs server nodes. Each lab will have a separate
                 container so that we can avoid memory leakage issues
                 of the labs.
		 - Cluster server nodes are 
		   + Router :: is for forwarding incoming packets to
                               respective server nodes
		   + Reverse proxy :: Accepts http and https packets
                                      from router and forwards these
                                      packets to respective labs.
		   + Public DNS :: For external name resolution 
		   + Private DNS :: For internal name resolution

		   + ADS :: A service for hosting new labs inside the
                            cluster

	 Static IP(192.168.1.4) is to be assigned to this box.

  - Porting Labs :: If there is any requirement for porting or
                    creating a new course on Open edX platform, we
                    have to follow the below steps
		    
		    - Get the lab/course sources from [[https://github.com/openedx-vlead][GitHub]] and
                      create tar ball.
		    - Import the lab into Vagrant Box (Open edX
                      platform studio)
**** Design plan has changed 
     Based on the design discussions.
       In VLEAD cluster setup we used VLEAD's private DNS for
       internal name resolution.
       
      After the implementation of this plan, we understood that we need
      one more external dns service running in container outside the
      cluster, so that we can use it's ip in Wi-Fi router to resolve
      fully qualified domain name(FQDN).
      
      
     - Decision ::
       	DNS service has to be configured for internal name resolution.

     Please see the changed design plan of [[Design%20Plan%20on%202016-09-26][Design Plan on 2016-09-26]]

  - Router :: Wi-Fi router is resolves the domain name(FQDN) of the
              labs within the LAN network. And it allocates dhcp ips
              to the Vagrant boxes and to the users who wants to acces

              provide 192.168.1.0/24 subnet ip range to its clients.

  - Virtual-Labs portable edition :: 
       A portable edition, which contains Open edX platform and ported
       labs onto it. Two vagrant boxes will be used for creating the
       portable edition. Two vagrant boxes are as follows.
       
       Static IP (192.168.1.3) is to be assigned to this machine. 

    + Vagrant Box (Open edX platform) ::
	 Virtual-Labs portable edition ,this box provides us Open edX
         platform with the labs ported onto it. For the simulations of
         experiments and for the images, this box contacts to *Cluster
         Vagrant box* for the labs over the LAN.

	 Static IP(192.168.1.4) is to be assigned to this box.
  
    + Vagrant Box (Cluster) :: 
         The box with cluster setup.  In this box, labs are
         hosted/deployed locally on OpenVZ containers. Each lab will
         have a separate container so that we can avoid memory leakage
         issues of the labs.

	 Static IP(192.168.1.4) is to be assigned to this box.

  - ELK stack :: ELK(Elasticsearch,Logstash and Kibana) stack. ELK is
                 for showing the analytics of the labs.

    + Elasticsearch - A storage, No Sql database. It acts as backend
      data store for logstash.
    + Logstash - A log processor, can process any data - from any source
    + Kibana - Analytics visualization tool. Acts as a frontend tool
      to logstash
**** Discontinued this plan
     Reasons why discontinued 
    - Setting up cluster in a vagrant box is difficult.
      Why ?::
      + VLEAD cluster setup is done based on bare metal machine not on
       	Vagrant box. we do not have bootstrapping steps for this kind
       	of setup.
      + Need more time to understand the network design of Vagrant Box
      + NAT rules (firewall rules) issues after creating vagrant
       	box. 
    - Okay with the setting up Open edX platform in a vagrant box     

** Hardware requirements
*** Proposed Machine and Wifi router specifications and requirements 
    The following requirements are captured based on discussion
    happened on <2016-09-28 Wed> 

    Attendees:  Siva, Sanchitha, Maruthi Rao and Biswajit, and Aashay
    also involved partly.

    Discussion:
    Portable media with 80 labs.
    Workshop with around 100 students. For this kind of workshop, what
    are all the things we need for portable media.
    Assumptions :: 
    - Workshop duration (Average duration of time) 3hrs and 6hrs 
    - Web services 70 and other services 10
    - Students in workshop - 50-100 
    - 30-40 simultaneous users accessing the labs
    - Rest of the people 70-60 ---> accesing edX
  
    Based on above assumptions we come up with the following basic
    requirements are needed for the poratable media and their
    approximate costs are as follows
    - AMD FX-8 series or Intel Xeonon processor -Rs.26K
    - Motherboard - Asus or Inetl Rs.40k-45K
    - RAM - 32GB
    - Non ECC RAM
    - Cooler -liquid cooler 10K
    - Cabinet - 6-7K
    - SMPS  - 6K
    - LAN switch
    - 3 wifi router with LAN ports
    - 50 cat5 cables with 2 mitres

*** ACTIONS Items
    -  Collect the systems requirements as mentioned in the above-
       Biswajit - Done
       + Biswajit has come up with the table of 3 builds/sets
	 These 3 builds/Sets are updated in [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/15774d2efec0c111?projector%3D1][Google Spreadsheet]]. 
	  Need to be discussed on this requirements and specifications

      
** Deployment process 
   Due to the size of Labs (and containers) and edX (Vagrant Box),
   creating a portable media will be as follows:
   1) Institute orders a Portable Media (to VLEAD Platform team)
   2) VLEAD creates Potable Media by following the above said procedure.
   3) Test the Portable Media
   4) Ship the Portable Media to the requesting institute.
* Meeting minutes of All hands meeting
** <2016-09-28 Wed>
  - Search based on keyword  and if possible institute and discipline
    wise search   - Ashay
  - Router spec for 200 people
  - Field workshop
  - Intel 7 , Xenon processor 
  - Conduct a workshop in one of the college for load testing and
    performance 
  - Facility for sending logs to central server to workshop
    coordinator.  - Done by Ashay
* COMMENT Memory Leakage labs
  - What could be the solution for hosting memory leakage labs on
    personal edition? 
    
    Solution could be:
    for Vagrant box *Vagrant box down* and *vagrant box up* and 
    for Personal edition, *shutdown and restart the machine*

  - How to find out the labs that are causing the memory leakage? 
  - Can we create OpenVZ/Docker containers for the memory leakage
    labs? is it a good idea?
