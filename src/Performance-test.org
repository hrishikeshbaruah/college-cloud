* Introduction
  The documnent describes the performance of the portable media.
* Test Cases 
  Following test cases are done based on below requirements
  - System Configuration :: 
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz   (Mother Board Model : intel-db75en)
       RAM : 16 GB
       SMPS : 600 W
       CPUs: 8
       MotherBoard wattage: 77 W
       #+END_EXAMPLE
  - Wifi-Router :: Belkin 

** Test Case1 :: Portable media pilot test at VLEAD conf room
*** Objective
    Check the  performance of the portable-media
*** Apparatus
    - At least 15 lab users with their laptops(VLEAD employees) 
    - Portable-media (SATA 500 GB Magnetic)
    - System configuration as mentioned above in the [[Test Cases]]
    - Wifi Router
*** Procedure
    - Setup a machine with portable-media
    - Choose the one of the lab on edX platform
    - Start chosen lab from OpenVZ web panel
    - Ask lab users to perform experiments
    - Monitor the RAN and CPU utilization
*** Experiments
    - Selected one lab =Image Processing lab= on Open edX platform
    - Started the lab on OpenVZ web panel
    - Students performed one experiment simultaneously
    - Selected second lab =Molecular Fluorescence Spectroscopy
      IIIT-Hyderabad= 
    - Students performed experiments simultaneously
    - Now, Started two more lab from OpenVZ panel, now Four labs
      running ( four OpenVZ containers)
*** Results/Summary of the Experiment

     |------+-----------------+-------------------+---------------------+-----------+----------+-------------|
*** Conclusion
    With the above system configuration, 10 students are able able to
    access four labs without any loading issue. 

    - Expectation :: With the above results, 20-30 students can access 2
                     labs simultaneously.
