* Introduction
  This document contains plan of building college cloud edition
  solution.
* Plan for next current college cloud edition.
    1) Some of the experiments are pointing to institute servers.
    2) Some labs are having internet needed links on the pages. 
    3) List down the labs that are having above issues and remove them
       from college cloud.
    4) Adding Experiment server in college cloud. So that we can
       reduce 29-30 openvz containers in college cloud cluster.
    5) Cloning the HDDs
       
** How many labs are problematic?

** Memory information of all other containers 
   By default, each openvz container ( including cluster containers)is
   having 256MB RAM.


** Proposed machine configuration for college cloud demos and deployments
   *Current Problem*: 

   Several performance issues are observed in the single machine
   version of college cloud. The main reason might be running VMs
   (edX) and time sensitive applications in containers, and many
   containers etc in a machine that is not not suitable for heavy
   virtualization, hardware acceleration.

   *Approach*:
   1) Reduce the number of VMs, Containers and edX to free resources during run time.
   2) Portable system for demonstration purpose.
   3) Deployment with workstation grade systems.

   One interim approach is splitting the college cloud into 2
   machines. One machine handles edX, analytics and other machine
   handles labs, clusters etc. The components can be shuffled as
   appropriate.

   *Demonstration of College Cloud*: 

   2 Laptops are used. It is portable and easy.  

   *Preferred Laptops*: Dell New Latitude 7480 with 16GB or 32 GB and
   i7 processor.  Note: Internal HDD should be used to demo college
   cloud. No USB HDD.

  *Deployment of College Cloud*: Once the demo is over, the institute
  will be given 2 HDD and deploy college cloud in 2
  machines. Workstation grade machines are preferred. 

  Preferred Machines: 2 Workstation grade machine. i7 / Xenon with
  32GB RAM.

  ================
  Long term approach: Redesign of College cloud with reduced footprint.

  Reduce / simplify resource intensive components / containers / VMs
  and run in one machine.
* Plan for new college cloud edition

  - By middle of the Summer we have to ready solid working CC
*** TODO
    - Identify content issues
    - Identify Operational issues.
      Who is consuming resources, RAM, CPUs ( web applications)
    
    
    - Machine Specs  
    - How many HDDs we are taking with us to Solan
    - Mailing list( google group) for college cloud edition users .
