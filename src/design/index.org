  - Wi-Fi Router :: Wi-Fi router resolves the domain name(FQDN) of the
              labs within the LAN network. And it allocates dhcp ips
              to the Vagrant boxes and to the users who wants to acces
              the labs. Configure the wi-fi router such that it has to
              provide 10.2.57.0/24 subnet ip range to its clients.

  - Portable edition of Virtual Labs :: 
       A portable edition, which contains Open edX platform and ported
       labs onto it. One vagrant box will be used for Open edX
       platform. Host machine will contain OpenVZ containers. Each
       container will have one lab. we call it as *Cluster*. You will
       read about the cluster later in this document.
       
       Static IP (10.2.57.61) will be assigned to this machine ( Host
       machine).

    + Vagrant Box (Open edX platform) ::
	 Virtual-Labs portable edition ,this box provides us Open edX
         platform with the labs ported onto it. For the simulations of
         experiments and for the images, this box contacts to
         *Cluster* for the labs over the LAN.

	 Static IP(10.2.57.65) is to be assigned to this box.
  
    + Cluster :: 
		 It runs on localhost (Host machine) and serves labs
                 to the Open edX platform. In this cluster, labs are
                 hosted/deployed locally on OpenVZ containers and also
                 runs server nodes. Each lab will have a separate
                 container so that we can avoid memory leakage issues
                 of the labs.
		 - Cluster server nodes are 
		   + Router :: is for forwarding incoming packets to
                               respective server nodes
		   + Reverse proxy :: Accepts http and https packets
                                      from router and forwards these
                                      packets to respective labs.
		   + Public DNS :: For external name resolution 
		   + Private DNS :: For internal name resolution

		   + ADS :: A service for hosting new labs inside the
                            cluster
	          
                   + Config-Server :: To configure cluster with
                                      automated scripts using ansible
                                      playbooks

		 Static IP(10.2.57.62) is to be assigned to Router
                 container.

		 Static IP(10.2.57.63) is to be assigned to
                 Config-server container.

  - DNS service :: Runs in separate container on localhost. This
                   service will be used by Wi-Fi router for name
                   resolution( To map IP with FQDN).
		   
		   DNS service will be configured using ansible
                   playbooks from config-server. Use =public_dns.yml=
                   playbook to configure DNS service
		   
		   Static IP :: 10.2.57.64
  - Nagios :: Nagios is a monitoring tool. Job of the nagios in this
              setup is to monitor system resources such as RAM,
              Processes,etc.
